<h1>The Beauty of Black Holes</h1>
<p> Black holes are a facinating intergalactical body, which possess great power. Black holes have their origins from supermassive stars, much larger and brighter than the sun which allows for us to prosper as animals. Black holes are extremely dangerous, with their gravtiation power warping time, being so strong, that even light cannot escape from its grasp. </p>
<h2> Harvesting Energy from Black Holes </h2>
<p> We can utilize the great power of black holes by having a bunch of strong mirrors surround the black hole, and then shoot an electronmagnetic pulse into the generator, and then close it back up. The black hole will keep on increasing the speed of the electromagnetic pulse, causing it to grow to extremely fast speeds, generating a lot of energy.</p>
<h2> The Consequences </h2>
<p> due to the extreme nature of black holes, the generators require very dilligent maintentence, as the mirrors need to be maintained, and a small crack or imperfection in the code can could the entire generator to explode like a supernova, creating one of the, if not, the most dangerous bomb by mankind. </p>

<h2> Required Materials </h2>
<ul>
  <li> A lot of mirror, depending on the size of the black hole. </li>
  <li> A black hole. </li>
  <li> A lot of dangerous labor, likely done autonomously to not lose lives.</li>
</ul>
